Steps on creating a repository and initializing it with local repository.
Log in to your GitHub account.
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Initialize it with a README file.
Create a new folder on your local machine by using this command 'mkdir folder name'
Navigate into the folder by using 'cd folder name'
Initialize it by 'git init'
Link your local repository to the GitHub repository with this command 'git remote add origin your repo url'
To Ensure that the remote repository has been added correctly run this command 'git remote -v'
Add your text files, folders etc.
Then add the changes 'git add .'
Commit changes 'git commit -m 'commit message'
Then push 'git push -u origin master'.
